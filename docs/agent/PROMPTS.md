# Synora Agent Prompt Template

Before implementing anything:

1. Read:
   - CONTEXT.md
   - DECISIONS.md
   - ARCHITECTURE (if exists)
   - ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md

2. Provide:
   - Plan (files to modify and why)
   - Then implement
   - Then add/update tests
   - Then provide verification commands

3. Constraints:
   - Do not introduce new frameworks.
   - Do not refactor directory structure.
   - Keep functions small and testable.
   - Avoid premature abstraction.
   - All code must be runnable.
